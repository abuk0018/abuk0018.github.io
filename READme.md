Portfolio 

This is my portfolio which include my skills and photos because this portfolio focused on my first skill which is photography and this is the first time i make my own.

Before i start to work on the code for this website, i did brainstorm and write down this portfolio for what! and what i want to show on it.

After that i did my XD layout for my portfoilo after i choose all the photos and write all the content.

In this website i introduce my self and add my personal picture on the home and about page.

I used CSS animation on the home page.

This portfolio i make for responsive web course, which is the final assignment.

In addition, in this portfolio i showed images on portfolio page which reflect my freelance work beside that i showed
 my skills on about page, which i acquired from IMD program .

 I want to make this site like what i see on the other portfoilo websites, but i cannot because i used Magnific popup plugins and the github cannot read it. Then I 
 asked my professor about that and he told me to delete it and i had to delete it.

 I always validate my HTML and CSS , all HTML pages are validation with out any wrong but the CSS i had the variables (var--)
 is wrong but this happened with me in my midterm assignment and the professor said that it does not wrong.
This project containes four pages, home,about,portfolio and contact.

I used on this project what my professor taught for us in this term such as flexbox layout, CSS grid layout on the bootstrap,
responsive Images, CSS animation and bootstrap.

Furtheremore, i used a little bit of JavaScript.

Installing:

I install font/Roboto from google font which i used Roboto-reqular.ttf.

I install fontawesome icons to add some icons to my portfolio in the footer.

I install isotope plugins to use it on my portfolio page which filter and sort magical layouts to the image.

I add jquery library to my HTML to help me to create animations but i did not use it.

I add JavaScript and i use it on my portfolio page only.

I add bootstrap link and i use it for all pages.

On my home page i keep it very simple and i used bootstrap on the navigation bar and on the footer.

On my about page i used bootstrap card framework.

On my portfolio i used bootstrap, Javascript and isotope.

Also on the contact page i used bootstrap form .
